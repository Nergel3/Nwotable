Nwotable is a [Vue.js](https://github.com/vuejs/vue) PWA inspired by the crazy work of [Fabio Spampinato](https://github.com/fabiospampinato) and his [app](https://github.com/notable/notable).

The app is still in development so some features may not work. Mobile devices aren't currently supported.
